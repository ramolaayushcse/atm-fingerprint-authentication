# 🔐 Fingerprint-Based ATM Authentication System

A modern and secure approach to ATM authentication using biometric fingerprint recognition — eliminating the need for traditional PINs or passwords.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Traditional banking systems rely on PINs and passwords, which are vulnerable to theft, shoulder-surfing, or brute-force attacks. This project proposes a more secure **biometric-based ATM system** where authentication is done through fingerprint recognition.

> 🔒 **Your fingerprint is your password.**
